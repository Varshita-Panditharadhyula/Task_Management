# Task_Management
A project I made using python which uses hash table to sort the files. 
This project is a File Organizer application with built-in User Authentication. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their files efficiently with sorting and retrieval functionalities.

Features
✅ User Authentication:

Secure user registration and login using SHA-256 password hashing.
✅ File Management:

View file details, including type, size, and modification date.
Sort files by type, size, or modification date.
Retrieve specific file details.
Add new files dynamically.
✅ Graphical Interface:

Uses Tkinter to display file details in an interactive UI.
